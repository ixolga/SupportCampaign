                    However, beeswax wrap is not recommended to use with raw meat. It can be DIY-ed as it is simple to make. 
                    You will only need cotton fabric, organic jojoba oil, and tree resin. 
                    there are many ways on how to make one by searching online. Click <a href ="https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/the-complete-guide-to-diy-beeswax-wraps-including-a-beeless-vegan-food-wrap">here</a>
