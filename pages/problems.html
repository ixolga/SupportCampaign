                                <p>
                                    Single-use plastics have been around for packaging items on delivery applications like Lazada and Shopee.
                                    This has been going on for years and had been causing plastic pollution due to the rise in usage of Lazada and Shopee, the usage of single-use plastics rose as well.
                                    In a time of a pandemic where people have limited movements or physical transactions, it is common to go for alternatives thatâ€™s why Lazada and Shopee gained a lot of users. 
                                    <br><br>The packaging of items makes use of plastic which people throw away after getting the item inside, and in that sense, it becomes a single-use plastic.
                                    This kind of packaging makes plastic pollution worse than before as an average user can order from multiple shops at least twice a month from the shopping apps.
                                    With that in mind, the single-use plastic being used is becoming more prevalent than before.

                            <p>
                                A survey in the Philippines has shown the country amount of single-use plastic and including nearly 60 billion sachets a year.
                                Every day, nearly 48 million shopping bags are used in the Philippines and increasing over 17 billion per year.
                                <br><br>More than half of non-recyclable plastic found in the survey came from sachets. Buying fish in the fish market inside the grocery store also uses a plastic.
                                The problem in grocery stores is, there are a lot of products that are put in sachets. It is rare to be able to buy coffee in bigger containers because most of them are in sachets.
                                Analyzing the survey, NGO hopes to persuade both the government and industry to take action on banning single-use plastic.

                            <h2>Sachet</h2>
                            <p>According to some reports, single-use plastic, specifically sachets, have been causing difficulties in the Philippines.
                                Every day, approximately 164 million sachets are used and are accountable for roughly 52 percent of the residual plastic waste stream.
                                <br><br>Although sachets may have supplied quality products to the poor communities, but once they are discarded, they can be a problem to the environment.
                                They have the capability of polluting the ocean, clog drains and as well as cause flooding.
                                In addition, sachets also lessen the effectiveness of reduce, reuse and recycle system.
                                The reason for this is because sachets contain other materials  that has high volume of residual waste.
                                Thus, they end up as trash, littering our cities.
