            <p>Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and climate problems of the world. It pollutes the air, water, and soil at every stage of its existence from extraction, to use and disposal.</p>
            <p>Single-use Plastic Products Regulation (SUPPORT) Campaign by the Climate Change Commission - Philippines aims to raise awareness about the harms of disposable plastics such as grocery bags, straws, cups and cutlery, bottles, or food packaging.

                        and human health for causing pollution of water bodies and death or injury to marine organisms, blockages in our drainage and waterways, 
                        and release of toxic gases when burned, etc.

                            Instead of a proposed nationwide ban on plastic bags, cups and straws, states are being 
                            asked to enforce existing rules on the storage, manufacture and use of some single-use plastics.
